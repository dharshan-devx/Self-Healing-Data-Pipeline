🔄 Self-Healing Data Pipeline

A production-grade framework to build resilient, observable, and automated data pipelines that can detect, diagnose, and recover from failures without human intervention.

📌 Executive Summary

Modern businesses depend on continuous, trustworthy data to power analytics, personalization, and AI.

Traditional pipelines:

Fail silently.

Recover slowly.

Require manual firefighting.

👉 This project delivers a Self-Healing Data Pipeline:

Automatically detects anomalies & failures.

Applies remediation (retry, fallback, quarantine, backfill).

Proves end-to-end lineage & governance.

✅ Outcomes → Reduced MTTR, protected SLAs/SLOs, increased trust in data.

🚨 The Problem (Why This Matters)
Business Symptoms

Late/missing dashboards; wrong KPIs during critical windows.

Fragile jobs that break on schema drift or API limits.

Incident response relying on Slack threads & “pipeline heroes.”

No clear answer to “Where did this number come from?”

Root Causes

Operational Fragility: One failing task blocks all downstream.

Low Observability: Scattered logs; no single view.

Poor Lineage/Governance: Weak auditability.

Change Volatility: API drift, late files, transient network errors.

Impact

💸 Revenue Loss: Missed personalization, campaign errors.

⏳ Ops Burden: Over-spend on on-call firefighting.

📉 Trust Gap: Stakeholders build shadow pipelines.

⚖️ Compliance Risk: Weak traceability.

💡 The Solution (What We Built)

A self-healing data platform with:

Proactive Detection – Health checks, freshness SLAs, schema/volume monitors.

Smart Remediation – Retries w/ jitter, circuit breakers, fallbacks, quarantines, backfills.

Lineage & Impact Analysis – End-to-end via OpenLineage.

Idempotency – Safe reruns, checkpoints, replay support.

Governance-Ready – Audit trails, metadata, policy enforcement.

🏗️ Reference Architecture

Airflow → Orchestration & scheduling.

PostgreSQL → Metadata DB + sink.

Marquez (OpenLineage) → Metadata & lineage.

Kafka + Zookeeper (optional) → Streaming + DLQs.

Neo4j (optional) → Graph lineage exploration.

🔄 How Self-Healing Works
Step 1: Detect

Heartbeats, freshness SLAs, schema drift, anomaly detection.

Step 2: Classify

Transient vs deterministic failures.

Upstream vs downstream.

Data quality vs infra issue.

Step 3: Remediate

Retries with exponential backoff + jitter.

Circuit break dependent tasks.

Fallback to cached snapshots or secondary APIs.

Quarantine bad data (dead-letter zone).

Backfill missing partitions.

Step 4: Prove & Learn

Emit OpenLineage metadata.

Log remediation actions.

Feed learnings into runbooks.

⚠️ Example Failure Scenarios
Scenario	Detection	Auto-Action	Outcome
API Rate-Limited	429 + SLA breach risk	Retry w/ jitter, fallback snapshot	Ingestion continues
Late Vendor File	Freshness breach	Pause downstream, auto-backfill later	Dashboards current
Schema Drift	Contract mismatch	Quarantine, notify, reprocess	No outage
Warehouse Write Failure	Insert timeout	Retry → staging fallback	SLA preserved
📊 Operational Model

SLAs/SLOs: Freshness (D+1 by 07:00 IST), reliability (>99.5%).

Idempotency: Partition-based reruns, checkpointing.

Observability: Airflow state, lineage graphs, metrics (MTTR, retries, quarantines).

🛡️ Governance & Security

Role-based access control.

PII tagging + propagation policies.

Full audit trails & lineage.

TLS + encryption at rest.

🚀 Setup Guide
Prerequisites

Docker & Docker Compose

Git

Python 3.10+ (for optional local CLI)

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/self-healing-data-pipeline.git
cd self-healing-data-pipeline

2️⃣ Start Services
docker-compose up -d --build

3️⃣ Create Airflow Admin User
docker-compose exec airflow-webserver airflow users create \
  --username admin --firstname YourName --lastname Admin \
  --role Admin --email admin@example.com --password admin

4️⃣ Access the UI

🌐 Airflow → http://localhost:8080

User: admin | Pass: admin

🛠️ Troubleshooting
Error	Fix
Airflow stuck on starting	docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d --build
No module named Airflow	docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d
DB migration issues	docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d
Port 8080 in use	Kill PID: `netstat -ano
📚 FAQ

Q: Does this replace data engineers?
A: No—it frees them from firefighting.

Q: Can it work with existing pipelines?
A: Yes—Airflow orchestrates Python/SQL/Spark/etc.

Q: How do we verify remediation?
A: Logged actions + lineage graphs.

Q: Is it compliance-safe?
A: Yes—auditable, encrypted, governed.
