# 🚀 Self-Healing Data Pipeline 🚀

A production-grade approach to building **resilient, observable, and automated data pipelines** that detect, diagnose, and recover from failures without human intervention.

---

## ✨ Executive Summary

Modern businesses depend on continuous, trustworthy data to power analytics, personalization, and AI. Traditional pipelines often fail silently, recover slowly, and demand significant manual effort—resulting in lost revenue, stale dashboards, and compliance risks.

**This project delivers a revolutionary *Self-Healing Data Pipeline*:** an orchestrated, observable, and governed flow that *automatically detects anomalies and failures*, *applies the right remediation strategy* (retry, fallback, quarantine, backfill), and *proves end-to-end data lineage*. It dramatically reduces Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR), protects critical SLAs/SLOs, and builds unwavering stakeholder trust in data.

## 💔 The Problem (Why this matters)

### Business Symptoms
*   ⏰ Late or missing dashboards; inaccurate KPIs during critical windows (e.g., finance close, campaign launch).
*   💥 Fragile batch jobs that break on upstream schema changes or API rate limits.
*   🦸 Incident resolution that relies on tribal knowledge, Slack threads, and one or two “pipeline heroes.”
*   ❓ Limited answers to simple questions like *“Where did this number came from?”* or *“What was the blast radius?”*

### Root Causes
*   **Operational Fragility:** 🕸️ One failing task often blocks all downstream tasks; manual reruns are error-prone.
*   **Low Observability:** 🕵️ Logs scattered across systems; no single view of task health and data dependencies.
*   **Poor Lineage & Governance:** 📉 Unclear source→transform→destination mapping; limited auditability.
*   **Change Volatility:** 🌪️ Upstream schema drift, API instability, late files, and transient infra/network failures are constant threats.

### Impact
*   **Revenue & Cost:** 💸 Missed personalization windows, stockouts, campaign misallocation; over-spend on on-call time.
*   **Trust:** 💔 Business users lose confidence in data; teams resort to building shadow pipelines.
*   **Compliance:** 📝 Weak traceability for audits and incident post-mortems.

## ✅ The Solution (What we built)

A **self-healing** data platform that seamlessly combines orchestration, lineage, and automated remediation.

### Core Capabilities

1.  **Proactive Detection:** 🩺 Health checks, data freshness SLAs, volume/profile monitors, and schema guards.
2.  **Smart Remediation:** 🩹 Tuned retries with jitter, circuit breakers, dynamic backoff, fallback sources, and quarantine/rewind for bad data.
3.  **Lineage & Blast-Radius Analysis:** 🗺️ End-to-end lineage (job, dataset, column) to quantify impact and drive safe rollbacks/backfills.
4.  **Idempotent, Re-runnable Tasks:** ✅ Safe to retry without duplicates; checkpointing and exactly-once/at-least-once strategies.
5.  **Governance-Ready:** 🔒 Audit trails, rich metadata, and policy hooks for PII and regulatory requirements.

### Reference Architecture (deployed in this repo)

*   **Airflow:** 🌬️ Orchestration and scheduling of DAGs (pipelines), retries, SLAs, and task dependencies.
*   **PostgreSQL:** 🐘 Durable metadata store (Airflow Metadatabase) and an example analytical sink.
*   **Marquez (OpenLineage):** 🔗 Operational metadata + data lineage for jobs and datasets.
*   **Kafka + Zookeeper (optional):** ⚡ Event streaming and dead-letter queues for real-time ingestion.
*   **Neo4j (optional):** 🌐 Graph store for advanced lineage queries or anomaly/impact exploration.

> Note: Kafka/Neo4j are optional depending on your specific use case. The self-healing patterns apply robustly to both batch and streaming scenarios.
